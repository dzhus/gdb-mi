* Being DRY
** TODO Derive buffers mode from one generic mode
   There's too much copy&paste in code for modes of various GDB
   buffers.

** DONE Write `gdb-def-frame-for-buffer`
   To define `gdb-frame-*-buffer` functions
  
** TODO Write `gdb-def-display-buffer`
   To define `gdb-display-*-buffer` functions
  
  
* Object approach
** Rewrite existing buffers
*** IN PROGRESS Frames list handler
    Ditch `gdb-stack-list-frames-regexp`, hack
    `gdb-stack-list-frames-handler` and `gdb-frame-handler`.
**** TODO Think of a better header
     This applies to other buffers as well
* New buffers
** IN PROGRESS [1/3] Threads
   - [X] basic information
   - [ ] keymap
   - [ ] current thread selection
** IN PROGRESS Disassembly
   - [X] basic information
         
         `-data-disassemble` command needs filename and line
         information, which can be learned from GDB with
         `-stack-info-frame` command. The code currently relies on
         *global* variables `gdb-selected-file` and
         `gdb-selected-line`, both set in `gdb-frame-handler`.

   - [ ] breakpoints

   - [ ] do not update disassembly buffer if the current function
         hasn't changed since last operation
         
   - [ ] keymap
         
   - [ ] hyperlinks for jump instructions

         Add clickable buttons for `jmp`, `jl` arguments
   

* GDB+Emacs interface improvements
   
* Multiple threads support
** TODO Buffer model review
   Several new concepts for GDB buffers must be introduced:
   
   - [ ] buffer-local variable with a number of thread this buffer shows
     information for

   - [ ] same for frame number

   - [ ] extend `gdb-get-buffer-create` etc. to allow working with
     buffers of the same type (like frames list) for several threads
     simultaneously

   - [ ] make sure thread selection interface is clear and intuitive

   - [ ] include thread information in buffer names to avoid confusion
** TODO Stack information
   There must be some way to examine stack info for different threads

* Black corners
  Unclear parts of code which I don't fully understand yet.
** gud-last-frame
** gdb-pending-triggers
