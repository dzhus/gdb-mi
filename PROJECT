* Being DRY
** TODO Derive buffers mode from one generic mode
   There's too much copy&paste in code for modes of various GDB
   buffers.

** DONE Write `gdb-def-frame-for-buffer`
   To define `gdb-frame-*-buffer` functions
  
** TODO Write `gdb-def-display-buffer`
   To define `gdb-display-*-buffer` functions
  
  

* New buffers
** IN PROGRESS [1/3] Threads
   - [X] basic information
   - [ ] keymap
   - [ ] current thread selection
** IN PROGRESS Disassembly
   - [ ] basic information
         
         `-data-disassemble` command needs filename and line
         information, which can be learned from GDB with
         `-stack-info-frame` command. New variables similar to
         `gdb-pc-address` should be introduced
         
   - [ ] hyperlinks for jump instructions

         Add clickable buttons for `jmp`, `jl` arguments
   


* Multiple threads support
** TODO Buffer model review
   Several new concepts for GDB buffers must be introduced:
   
   - [ ] buffer-local variable with a number of thread this buffer shows
     information for

   - [ ] same for frame number

   - [ ] extend `gdb-get-buffer-create` etc. to allow working with
     buffers of the same type (like frames list) for several threads
     simultaneously

   - [ ] make sure thread selection interface is clear and intuitive

   - [ ] include thread information in buffer names to avoid confusion
** TODO Stack information
   There must be some way to examine stack info for different threads

* Black corners
  Unclear parts of code which I don't fully understand yet.
** gud-last-frame
** gdb-pending-triggers
